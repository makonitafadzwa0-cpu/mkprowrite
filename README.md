# mkprowrite

mkprowrite — project repository.

## Open Graph image added

An Open Graph image (og-image.svg) has been added to improve link previews when the site is shared. The image is 1200x630 and is referenced from index.html via the following URL:

https://makonitafadzwa0-cpu.github.io/mkprowrite/og-image.svg

Meta tags added/updated in index.html:
- link rel="canonical" set to the GitHub Pages site URL
- og:image set to the hosted og-image.svg with og:image:width and og:image:height
- Twitter card (summary_large_image) added
- JSON-LD "url" updated to the GitHub Pages URL

## GitHub Pages

To publish the site via GitHub Pages:

1. Go to the repository Settings > Pages.
2. Under "Source", select the branch `main` (or your default branch) and the folder (root or /docs) where the site is located.
3. Save. Your site will be available at:

   https://makonitafadzwa0-cpu.github.io/mkprowrite/

If your default branch is not `main`, choose the correct branch in the Pages settings.

If you'd like changes to the image design, different filenames, or to host the image in a subdirectory, tell me how you'd like it adjusted and I will update the files.
