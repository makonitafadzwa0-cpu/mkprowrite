# Mk ProWrite — Website (Static)

What you have
- index.html — the main page (SEO meta + Open Graph + structured data)
- styles.css — external stylesheet

WhatsApp number added
- Displayed phone: +27 60 905 5948
- WhatsApp (wa.me) link: https://wa.me/27609055948

Quick edits you should make (optional)
- Replace `https://example.com/` and `https://example.com/og-image.jpg` in the meta tags / JSON-LD with your real domain and image URL (recommended for social sharing).
- Replace the email address if you prefer a different contact email.

Preview locally
1. Save `index.html` and `styles.css` in the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser OR run a local server:
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000`
   - Node (http-server): `npx http-server` then open the printed URL

Deployment options
- GitHub Pages: push to a repository and enable Pages.
- Netlify / Vercel: drag & drop the folder or connect your repo for CI deploys.

Next steps I can take for you
- Create a GitHub repository and push these files (tell me repo name and whether to create under your account or another owner).
- Create a ZIP and provide a download link here.
- Add a contact form that sends messages to your email (Formspree, Netlify Forms, or small serverless function).
- Add a logo, optimized Open Graph image and other branding.
- Set up a one-click deploy to Netlify or Vercel.

Which would you like me to do next?
